<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hi, my name is Guga and I’m a beginner web developer who is learning how to build simple and clean websites.
I’m currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and the basics of web structure, while improving my understanding of how websites work behind the scenes.
I enjoy learning by practicing, breaking things, fixing them, and making steady progress step by step.

This website is part of my learning journey, where I experiment with layouts, images, and content structure.
My goal is to become more confident with front-end development and later expand into more advanced technologies.
I believe consistency and practice are the key to improving my skills and building better projects over time.
